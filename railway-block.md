# üö® RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- Railway is still connected to GitHub repository  
- Railway deployment failures are blocking Render deployments
- GitHub webhook conflicts between Railway and Render

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
1. ‚úÖ GitHub Workflow created: `.github/workflows/deploy-render-only.yml`
2. ‚úÖ Blocks Railway deployments on every push

## MANDATORY: Remove Railway Connection
**You must manually disconnect Railway from GitHub:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/nljolie/credli-ai/settings/hooks
2. **Delete Railway webhook** (the failing deployment hook)
3. **Keep only Render.com webhook**

OR

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. **Delete/Disconnect** the credli-ai project completely
3. This will remove GitHub integration

## VERIFICATION

- Railway deployments blocked
- Render.com receives clean webhook notifications
- No more deployment conflicts

## RESULT
‚úÖ All future pushes ‚Üí Render.com ONLY  
‚ùå Railway completely blocked/removed
