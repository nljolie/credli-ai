# Trust Factor™ AI Search Intelligence Platform

## What It Is
Trust Factor is a revolutionary AI search intelligence platform that measures how much artificial intelligence engines trust you as an authoritative source in your field. As AI search becomes the dominant way people find experts and solutions, your Trust Factor score determines whether you're seen as the go-to authority or completely invisible.

## The Two-Sided Problem

### Side 1: Trust Authority
Your legitimate expertise needs to be recognized by AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews) when people search for solutions in your field.

### Side 2: Imposter Threat
Bad actors create fake profiles, websites, and content using variations of your name, credentials, and reputation to steal your business and damage your credibility.

## How Trust Factor Scoring Works

### The Formula: Weighted Multi-Factor Analysis

**Trust Factor = (Visibility × 40%) + (Authority × 25%) + (Consistency × 20%) + (Competitive Context × 15%) - Imposter Penalty**

### 1. Visibility Score (40% Weight)
- **What it measures:** How often you appear when AI engines answer questions in your expertise area
- **Why it matters:** No visibility = no business. This is the foundation.
- **Calculation:** (Times you appear / Total relevant queries) × 100

### 2. Authority Score (25% Weight) 
- **What it measures:** Your ranking/position when you do appear (1st, 2nd, 3rd mention)
- **Why it matters:** Being mentioned 5th is very different from being mentioned 1st
- **Calculation:** Based on average position across all appearances
  - 1st position = 100 points
  - 2nd position = 80 points  
  - 3rd position = 60 points
  - 4th+ position = 40 points

### 3. Consistency Score (20% Weight)
- **What it measures:** How reliably you perform across different AI engines
- **Why it matters:** True authority shows up everywhere, not just on one platform
- **Calculation:** Based on variance between your performance on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews

### 4. Competitive Context Score (15% Weight)
- **What it measures:** Your market share of mentions vs. competitors
- **Why it matters:** Dominating mindshare in your field
- **Calculation:** Your mentions / (Your mentions + Competitor mentions) × 100

### 5. Imposter Penalty (Up to -15 Points)
- **What it measures:** Fake profiles, imposters, and fraudulent accounts using your name
- **Why it matters:** Imposters dilute trust and confuse AI engines about who the real authority is
- **Calculation:** -2 points per detected imposter (max -15 point penalty)

## Trust Factor Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **80-100** | **Elite Authority** | You dominate AI search in your field. Clients find you first. |
| **60-79** | **Strong Presence** | Well-positioned with room to reach elite status. |
| **40-59** | **Building Authority** | Good foundation, strategic improvements needed. |
| **20-39** | **Low Visibility** | Significant gaps in AI search presence. |
| **0-19** | **Invisible/At Risk** | AI engines don't recognize your expertise. Critical action needed. |

## How Imposters Affect Your Trust Factor

### The Imposter Dilution Effect
When imposters create fake profiles using variations of your name:

1. **Direct Penalty:** -2 points per detected imposter (up to -15 total)
2. **Indirect Damage:** AI engines get confused about who the real authority is
3. **Market Share Loss:** Imposters steal mentions that should be yours
4. **Consistency Disruption:** Different engines may show different "versions" of you

### Example Imposter Impact:
- **Sarah Johnson** (real expert) has a Trust Factor of 75
- **3 imposters detected:** "Dr. Sarah Johnson", "Sarah Johnson AI", "Sarah Johnson Consulting"
- **Direct penalty:** -6 points (3 imposters × -2 each)
- **Indirect damage:** AI engines split mentions between real and fake versions
- **Final Trust Factor:** 69 (down from potential 75+)
