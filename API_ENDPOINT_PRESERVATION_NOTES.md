# API Endpoint Preservation Notes

## 🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT DELETE API ENDPOINTS

### `/api/free-cred-score` - MUST BE PRESERVED

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE & FUNCTIONAL  
**Purpose:** API endpoint for cred score analysis  
**Used by:** `/cred-score.html` page  
**Location:** `server.js` lines 856-859  

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
- **The API endpoint `/api/free-cred-score` is still functional and working in server.js**
- **Leave it as-is since renaming APIs can break things**
- **The endpoint name doesn't matter as long as it works**
- **This endpoint is for the APIs only**

#### 🔧 Technical Details:
```javascript
// Server.js implementation
app.use('/api/free-cred-score', serverSideProtection);
app.post('/api/free-cred-score', async (req, res) => {
  // Functional API logic here
});
```

#### 🎯 What Was Deleted vs Preserved:
- ❌ **DELETED:** `public/free-cred-score.html` (problematic HTML page)
- ❌ **DELETED:** `public/free-cred-score.js` (problematic JavaScript file)  
- ✅ **PRESERVED:** `/api/free-cred-score` (functional API endpoint)

#### 📋 Usage:
- Called by `/cred-score.html` via `fetch('/api/free-cred-score', {...})`
- Handles all cred score analysis requests
- Provides backend processing for user scans
